	Abstract = {This paper compares results from evaluations of two recent road pricing demonstrations in southern California. These projects provide particularly useful opportunities for measuring commuters{\~O} values of time and reliability. Unlike most revealed preference studies of value of time, the choice to pay to use the toll facilities in these demonstrations is relatively independent from other travel choices such as whether to use public transit. Unlike most stated preference studies, the scenarios presented in these surveys are real ones that travelers have faced or know about from media coverage. By combining revealed and stated pref- erence data, some of the studies have obtained enough independent variation in variables to disentangle effects of cost, time, and reliability, while still grounding the results in real behavior. Both sets of studies find that the value of time saved on the morning commute is quite high (between $20 and $40 per hour) when based on revealed behavior, and less than half that amount when based on hypothetical behavior. When satisfactorily identified, reliability is also valued quite highly. There is substantial heterogeneity in these values across the population, but it is difficult to isolate its exact origins.},

	Abstract = {This paper suggests the Burr distribution as a useful statistical model to represent travel time reliability through studies of the day-to-day variability in travel times on journeys in urban areas. This distribution has a flexible shape and the ability to describe the very long upper tails (and hence significant skewness) seen in observed distributions of travel time variations. This result provides a means to study travel time reliability in more detail, and in line with recent research on indices of travel time reliability. The Burr distribution is algebraically tractable, which means that percentile values can be computed directly. In this way various travel time reliability metrics, such as the FHWA Buffer Index and the Delft skewness parameters can be computed from the fitted Burr parameters. This opens the way to the inclusion of reliability as a consideration in economic analysis, using a metric that can better reflect the nature of travel time variability. A case study example, using real world data, illustrates the proposed computational method for the travel time reliability metrics.},

@article{martchouk:2010,
	Abstract = {Travel time and travel time reliability are important performance measures for
assessing traffic condition and extent of congestion on a roadway. This study first uses a
floating car technique to assess travel time and travel time reliability on a number of
Indiana Highways. Then the study goes on to describe the use of Bluetooth technology to
collect real travel time data on a freeway and applies it to obtain two weeks of data on
Interstate-69 in Indianapolis. An autoregressive model, estimated based on the collected
data, is then proposed to predict individual vehicle travel times on a freeway segment.
This model includes speed, volume, time of day indicators, and previous vehicle travel
times as independent variables. In addition to the autoregressive formulation, a duration
model is estimated based on the same travel time data. The duration model of travel time
provided insights into how one could predict the probability of a car's duration of time on
a roadway segment changed over time. Interestingly, the three duration models estimated
(all hours, peak hour and night time models) showed that the point where the conditional
probability of travel times becoming longer occurs roughly at the onset of level-ofservice
F conditions. Finally, a seemingly unrelated regression equation model to predict
travel time and travel-time variability is estimated. This model predicts 15-minute
interval travel times and standard deviation of travel time based on speed, volume and
time of day indicators. The model has a very good statistical fit and thus can be used in
the field to compute real-time travel time using data available from remote traffic
microwave sensors.},

	Abstract = {Travel behavior researchers have long been intrigued by the amount of time people allocate to travel in a day. This paper revisits this issue by introducing the hazard-based duration model to travel time analysis. In the hazard-based duration model daily travel time is analyzed through the likelihood of ending the duration depends on the length of elapsed time since start of the duration, which incorporates the impacts of covariates and enables the test of travel time dependence on the elapsed time. Using travel data from the Beijing Third Comprehensive Transport Survey, this paper sheds new light on daily travel time by analyzing the relationships between daily travel time and socio-demographic attributes and activity and travel characteristics. Furthermore the estimated results illustrate that the behavior of most commuters can be represented by travel minimization mechanism. It is demonstrated that hazard-based duration model, integrating the notion of temporal dynamics, is a suitable tool for duration data analysis in travel behavior research.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on identifying important factors that determine activity-based travel distance in urban areas. Building on past research that has demonstrated the conceptual equivalence of hazard models applied to either temporal or spatial settings, the length of the distance from origin to destination is statistically modeled as longitudinal data using hazard-based modeling methods with data from Athens, Greece. Based on the data analysis, the Weibull model with gamma heterogeneity provides the best statistical fit, and a number of factors significantly affect travel distance, including socioeconomics and demographics, trip characteristics, mode choice, trip frequency, time of day for the trip, and type of activity participation. The proposed methodological approach and the research findings help to better understand travel behavior in terms of trip distance in the urban areas, an issue of significant importance for both transportation researchers and planners.

	Abstract = {Travel time reliability is an important system performance measure for freeway traffic operations. It captures the variability experienced by individual travelers, and it is an indicator of the operational consistency of a facility over an extended period. Real-life transportation data were used to develop a new methodology for estimating travel time reliabil- ity of the I-4 corridor in Orlando, Florida. Four different travel time dis- tributions were tested: Weibull, exponential, lognormal, and normal. The developed best-fit statistical distribution (lognormal) can be used to compute and predict travel time reliability of freeway corridors and report this information in real time to the public through traffic man- agement centers. When compared with existing Florida and buffer time methods, the new reliability method showed higher sensitivity to geo- graphical locations, which reflects the level of congestion and bottle- necks. Another advantage of the new method is its ability to estimate the travel time reliability as a function of departure time.},

	Abstract = {This paper jointly examines the length between successive participations in several activity purposes using a 1999 multi-week travel survey conducted in the German cities of Halle and Karlsruhe. A multivariate hazard model that accommodates a flexible duration dynamics structure, recognizes the effects of covariates, incorporates the variation in interepisode duration due to unobserved individual-specific factors and variation in interepisode duration within spells of the same individual, and considers the joint nature of participation in the various activities is proposed and applied. The variables considered in the analysis include demographics, access to the internet, location characteristics, and day of week variables. The results indicate a very distinct weekly rhythm in individuals' participation in social, recreation, and personal business activities. While there is a similar rhythm even for participation in shopping activities, it is not as pronounced as for the non-shopping activity purposes. Also, individuals and spouse attributes, household characteristics, residential location and trip-making variables, and day of week effects have a strong influence on interepisode durations.},

@inproceedings{chen:2007,
	Abstract = {In this paper, the available data logs collected from taxis are used to analyze the temporal distribution characteristics of the travel time reliability on the road network in Beijing. Three different measures are applied to quantify the travel time reliability during different time-of-the-day (TOD) and day-of-the-week (DOW) periods, namely the Coefficient of Variations (CV), the Planning Rate Index (PRI), and the Probability Indicator (PI). The probability indicator is a novel measure developed in this paper to evaluate the reliability of a road network, which is defined as the probability that the travel rate (travel time per unit distance) is less than a threshold value. The paper then discusses the effectiveness of these measures from the analytical standpoint. The travel rate distribution at an AM peak hour on Wednesday is modeled and the result indicates that a lognormal distribution shows better approximation performance. It is observed that both skewness and width of the travel rate distribution are related to the travel time reliability. Therefore, the probability indicator, considering both width and skewness of the travel rate distribution, is more robust for assessing the travel time reliability than the coefficient of variation and the planning rate index which merely consider the width of the travel rate distribution. Finally, the characteristics analysis of the travel time reliability for different TOD-DOW periods demonstrates that there is a strong relationship between the reliability and congestion. The reliability is low during the peak hours when the congested conditions occur, whereas the reliability is high during the off-peak hours.},

	Abstract = {The estimation of path or trip travel-time reliability is critical to any advanced traveler information system. The state-of-practice procedures for estimating path travel-time reliability assumes that travel times follow a normal distribution and requires a measure of trip travel-time variance. The study analyzes AVI data from San Antonio and demonstrates through goodness-of-fit tests that the assumption of normality is, from a theoretical standpoint, inconsistent with field travel-time observations and that a lognormal distribution is more representative of roadway travel times. However, visual inspection of the data demonstrates that the normality assumption may be sufficient from a practical standpoint given its computational simplicity. The paper then proposes five methods for the estimation of path travel-time variance from its component segment travel-time variances. The analysis demonstrates that computing the trip travel-time coefficient of variation as the conditional expectation over all realizations of roadway segments provides estimates within 13% of field observations for both uncongested and congested conditions.},

@article{mogridge:1984,
	Abstract = {In this note the authors report on a survey of the journey times on a single particular route measured day by day over a six-month period for the morning journey to work and the evening journey from work by car. The journey is across central London from a road in Clapham to the Transport Studies Group (TSQ) in Flaxman Terrace; differences in length between the morning and evening runs are due to the extensive one-way systems in central London. The start times of the journeys are essentially the same each day. The authors confirm the work of Smeed and Jeffcoate who reported on a study of similar journeys. The authors obtained a coefficient of variation of journey speeds of traffic in central London of about 0.20 in the morning peak and about 0.15 in the evening. The evidence suggests, though not strongly, that a log-normal distribution is a better representation of reality than a normal for central London journeys in the peak. (TRRL)},

	Abstract = {We derive the value of reliability in the scheduling of an activity of random duration, such as travel under congested conditions. Using a simple formulation of scheduling utility, we show that the maximal expected utility is linear in the mean and standard deviation of trip duration, regardless of the form of the standardised distribution of trip durations. This insight provides a unification of the scheduling model and models that include the standard deviation of trip duration directly as an argument in the cost or utility function. The results generalise approximately to the case where the mean and standard deviation of trip duration depend on the starting time. An empirical illustration is provided.},
